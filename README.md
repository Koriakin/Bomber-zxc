Hello, devils! 
These two codes are designed so that you can anonymously spam your friend or enemy's phone. Let me explain how they work.

The first is a simple version that makes a request to the FixPrice site asking for a code to register. The person will get messages like this: 
Your confirmation code: 6666

The second one checks the phone number for correctness, then sends the request, and displays the results on the screen.
